This program is a JavaScript quiz made with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. 
It uses a countdown timer and turns digits red under 10 seconds.
The user answers 5 questions then after the fifth question, the score is displayed.
The user is given the option to save their initials.
I could not get the storage to save the user's scores to the list. 
I also could not get the timer to subtract the time when a wrong question is answered. 
The program uses audio files, JavaScript and HTML with no Booostrap.
